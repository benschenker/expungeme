    <h3>STEP 1: DO YOU QUALIFY FOR AN EXPUNGEMENT?</h3>
    <div>
        A person may file a motion to expunge a record of his arrest for a felony or misdemeanor offense that did not result in a conviction if any of the following apply:
        <ol>
            <li>
                The person was not prosecuted for the offense for which he was arrested, and the limitations on the institution of prosecution have barred the prosecution for that offense.
            </li>
            <li>
                The district attorney for any reason declined to prosecute any offense arising out that arrest.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prosecution was instituted and such proceedings have been finally disposed of by dismissal, sustaining of a motion to quash, or acquittal.
            </li>
        </ol>
